# Connection
The SDE3 system is accessed over the end-to-end encrypted network. Users first establish a connection to the SDE Desktop and then authenticate to SDE3 from within the SDE Desktop. The SDE Desktop serves as a secure Windows-based gateway to the Linux-based SDE3 HPC environment. Data cannot be transferred directly from SDE3 to end-user devices.<br><br>

### ThinLinc

ThinLinc is a remote desktop server application. It is recommended to
use ThinLinc when you run software that requires a graphical user
interface, or "GUI" (e.g., Stata, MATLAB). To use ThinLinc to connect
to SDE3, please take the following steps on the SDE desktop:

1. Open a browser (Chrome or Firefox) and enter
   `https://sde.rcc.uchicago.edu` in the address bar.

2. Enter your CNetID and password on the ThinLinc login page:<br><br>
